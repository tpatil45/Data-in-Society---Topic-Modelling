The text explained how measurable types are often as if and not always accurate when depicting something. A severe gap is the loss of immeasurable traits that go missing when using a measurable type.,"In the ""Shimon"" example, the jazz robot was using computer processing power to configure an algorithm which would pick up on notes and then configure music by combining these notes. These automated systems are trained to do just this but can have issues listening depending on audio quality. Furthermore, if a Jazz artist was to add their own notes to a pre-existing track, the robot would have difficulties configuring the music. I believe it does not fully capture the nuance of the music and history because it is only able to do what algorithm it has learned,"

Googles data for example categorizes men and women into different groups based off common google searches for who they deem as men and women. for example it mentioned how a women doing bio research was considered a man by google analytics because of the disparity between men and women in that field.","The Shimon example is one of the many examples that shows the faults with algorithms and how the incorporation of data is not always consistent. The system used data that was put together by an individual so the data was subjective in the sense that their was bias apart of the collection of music. The issue with these automated systems is that music and its genres are very subjective so its hard to label and categorize music as jazz. What one person might call jazz another might call the blues there is no right answer, only opinions. "

The book always points out that there is difference between a terrorist and a 'terrorist.' One is a criminal who seeks to do harm upon others, while one is a collection of data points about someone's location and social interaction history. ","The Jazz robot configured music by being fed data points of the performances of famous jazz musicians, to the point where the robot could replicate the play style of those musicians. A possible consequence of the use of such an automated system is that when a robot plays a certain type of music, it ignores the demographic characteristics of the artists who pioneered that style, and reduces the art down to just what you can hear. This is why it doesn't effectively capture the nuance of music and jazz history, because it loses the personal element."

This led the google personalized ad page to give a very skewed view of 'herself'. They even had classified her as an older man. This was very similar to our discussion of when we search the word professor in google, not always will the most correct output come out rather our personal biases in google users and developers that have been aggregated. ","Yes, I do believe that it has the ability to capture the nuance of the music. It starts off by leading in saying that the music needs to be heard and move with Jazz. They created a machine named 'Shimon"" that not only had the ability to copy all of the required songs and noises. But also was a machine that could learn to adapt and continuously change by learning more and more sounds, and rhythms. Similar to an artist the computer will continue to learn throughout its life. A consequence of using such a system does take away from the true identity of musicians, the way they read, hear, and understand music is part of their own character. An seeing music from the ground roots up will never be able to be fully understood by a data scientist, even if they are are able to create a mere identical like system"

Basically there is a predefined notion of a measurable type based on past data, and when new data is collected, patterns are deciphered within. This can lead to completely wrong descriptions of a measurable type.","Shimon was given hundreds of sheets of music, from both famous Jazz artists, and the creators personal music creations, in order to algorithmically respond to music being played around it. Although Shimon could play music excellent, it needed to be fed this data. It had no knowledge of the Harlem Renaissance or current Jazz trends unless fed this music information. A possible consequence is the missed cues of culture or cultural appropriation. People are dynamic, and if a machine like Shimon is not up to date, it could do/play something not appropriate. Like Google AI repeating back racists swear words."

A measurable type cannot adapt to this change right away and can misconstrue the actually meaning of the data collected.,The Shimon robot created jazz music by combining two different jazz artists music together and calling it it's own.The problem with this is that although it can possibly create a sound similar to most jazz music it is missing the true meaning behind every note. There is much more to data than at the surface and only a human can create and understand that deeper meaning.

Based on certain things looked up or key words, the computer recognizes that and then determines the gender or type of individual that you are. For instance, the machine is taught what is meant to be an ""old man"" and then interprets specific data accordingly. Furthermore, big data generates measurable types. ","The system algorithmically configured music by ""machine learning"". Shimon learned how to play jazz from the data in the database. He relied on these machine algorithms  to learn.  Consequences that come with this  is that he has to learn how it adapts to change. Good musicians are able to put together the music with individuals and see how that correlates, so I think by only knowing the structure over ""machine learning"" helps to lose the real time connection of music in a real life environment with people. You lose the history and identities of what the Jazz really means and where it comes from."

With misinterpretations, sometimes measurable types would not be able to properly identify something.

Possible consequences could be that the robot will misread the music. With it not being an actual person, I do think that there is an effort to capture the ""nuance"" of music, but it is not completely adapting to jazz history. "

Measurable types take out the human in us. Also, in essence we do not exist if there is no data type that we fit in. Measurable types take the uniqueness out of each and every one of us, and turns us into bits. From atoms to bits as was mentioned in the readings.","Shimon follows what jazz is currently by predictive statistical modeling. Shimon parsed the solos of both musician Monk and Coltrane, and their pitches, volumes, and rhythm patterns. Shimon studies the commonalities. Coltrane, Monk, and the players that would play beside him become measurable types. 

 Some of the consequences with this is that a robot does not have the all the soul and knowledge from what jazz is and the nuance of music. It is the objectification of music . The robot is not playing jazz. The robot full of code and algorithms that is being run. Another consequence is that it only captures at most 50% one of the musicians or 'you'."

Life can either be made useful, measurable, and controlled by data or put to waste and not monitored. As the government conducts individuals, it is shown who we are seen to be and how we are assigned resources. ","Possible consequences of using an automated system such as ""Shimon"" can lead to overriding of systems and hacking. These machines can grow smarter over time and expand their algorithmic identification of 'you'. This new form of human and robot communication works together to improvise new beats and rhythms. As the algorithms collected are only from Big Data and Deep Learning, this product creates mixes of classical and jazz music and is always one step ahead of the human musician's brain. Shimon can only play a composition not a specific song. "
