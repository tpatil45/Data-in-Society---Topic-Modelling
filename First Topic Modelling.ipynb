In doing so, the app has set aside characteristics and pieces of layout that will be tailored to the gender I select. These are measurable and have multiple different answer choices that may change the functionality.\"\n",

The data points that are gathered for these range from location data, websites, aliases, connections, etc. A measurable type I have encountered is “Skateboarder”. If they wear skate clothes, smoke, are, and have tattoos then online they could definitely be labeled as such. I fit none of those data points but skateboard very well.'\n",

Terrorists were being grouped together by data based of societal information that is not always descriptive of a terrorist. With the new data the amount of drone strikes on \"terrorists\" increased significantly which raised suspicions on how accurate the data truly was.'\n",

These templates are most often used to assign users an identity, an algorithmic identification that compares streams of new data to existing datafied models. There are different characteristics both positive and negative that allow us to interpret an individuals measurable type. An example of a measurable type is that I am jewish. Being that my last name is Cohen, on a day to day basis it is recognized that I have a very Jewish last name, so I am identified as this often. There are other characteristics about me like my practices, my accessories, etc. that help to define me as jewish, which individuals can gather and interpret for my specific measurable type. '\n",

This connection is like the example from the book on signature strikes, where the definition of a terrorist is actually just the collection of data points that constitute terrorist like action. Another example of a measurable type from my life could be the way that my consumer behavior is tracked by Amazon, so for when I buy jelly I will be marketed peanut butter.

My identity as a female is different the datafied female, but because I would imagine that in terms of being a female from a data perspective, they would see that I have purchased feminine products online, looked at makeup, and looked up skirts and dresses that because of those activities it has matched the pre existing category of what a \"female\" would have their online history.']\n",

In regards to Facebook, Facebook's programming is set to record and calculate the percentage-value of how sexual one's Facebook status updates are.

These data points come with the same biases that were talked about in our first lecture (HP Camera Scandal).

In terms of societal consequences that we have because of these categorizations and limitations, the biases that we have will exude and be integrated when our identities are being created online.

      " 'I am a black woman, and in data terms I could be (depending on what I am labeled as) a \"black\" + \"woman\". So if an ad company wants to get my attention by showing me makeup for example, if Maybelline has a foundation line that is only usable for people with white and light skin tones, then I will not click on that ad. But because I am labeled as a \"black\" + \"woman\", they might show me makeup from black owned businesses, or makeup that is dark skinned friendly and has a foundation line that matches darker complexion. The implications of protocategorical insectionalities will allow me to be targeted better. Businesses, ads, and companies will have an easier time trying to get my attention because they can see multiple parts of my \"identity\", and use all of that data in order to best catch my attention. I then become an easier target .'\n",
