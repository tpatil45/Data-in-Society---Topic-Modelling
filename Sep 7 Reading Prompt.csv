By intertwining defining characteristics it goes beyond the racial and classist explanations and becomes a new defining identity that Google and other companies can define in their own ways. "

Using measurable types such as “man” or “black were inefficient at precisely targeting and grouping people. Instead, data that was able to be collected for anything a user did was utilized to define in the moment what a “man” was, and then used to define subsections of what a “man” was. This leads to protocategorical intersectionality where defining the multiple meanings for “man” constantly fluctuates based on data history.","The implication this could have on my online experience is that the meaning of a “man” could be shifted depending on what is popular among data for men in the moment. Likewise, a deeper definition for specifically myself “male skateboarder” may be shifted between “female skateboarder” based on the specific searches that I choose to make the data that is collected on me."

For example, in my case, I would be viewed as not only a male but I am also Caucasian. Due to this, these categories intersect with each other and create a white male category. In todays world, I would view this as a protocategory which has not experienced the same inequalities that others have. For example, a person who is a woman and also a person of color has had to endure the oppression of both categories and subsequently the categories together.","Protocategorical intersectionality can have many influences on the online user experience. Due to the fact these internet conglomerates have been able to collect and analyze data from almost every single aspect of our lives, we are constantly being placed into categories and furthermore, protocategories. Implications can stretch as far as the distinct personalized ads we encounter on websites to even recommendations of who to follow or friend request on social media apps."

It not only defines a gender but also a ""race, class, age, etc"". It analyzes a number of things such as type of tweets and interactions used. It develops a category based on the language of cultural interfaces made up largely from other elements. In other words, the term 'man' is used as a data object to assign behavior rather than a social and political identity. Protocategorical intersectionality helps to avoid preexisting gender assignments. ","On Twitter, the data set takes a cluster of tweets in order to demonstrate the correlation between different styles and languages used. This furthers down the data set to a 'type of man' and generates an inference from a bunch of category intersections. On the app Angry Birds, the users are categorized based on their swing. The type of swing performed to execute the pigs using the birds, aggregates data about your smartphone and distinguishes the real 'swingers' from the 'fake' swingers. This then determines the ""ethnicity"" of a swinger only based off of imperfection and inconsistency of the measurable type. "

Where they specifically highlighted the difference between example group c11 and c20. Group c20 produced outputs of almost all male like terms while group c11 produced the opposite being female. We remember back tot he readings from before that neither of the denominations constitutes real gender, rather an idea of what the data might think your gender is. A certain grouping of words may put you into one category, categories that have been formed on deeper levels than just man/woman or white/black. They want to develop a deeper understanding of our emotions and social interactions through large data. ","The implications of this could cause you to be microtargeted into a segment that you don't naturally fall into, and surf through thousands of ads that are completely wrong while the right ads could be playing. Developers also seem to have biases for using the triggers that result in one specific grouping. The program will only run as well as those who were designing it, and answering questions like what words constitute manliness, whiteness, or even marriedness could be skewed very easily. "

This is taken from a big set of data, and within is patterns and correlations from these large sets in which individuals analyze and interpret based off the information. It is how websites such as Google make intersectionality functional but understand that they are not 100% accurate. They are made after the clustered categories are created. ","Protocategorical intersectionality does not look at things separately, but rather together which can be a negative effect to its use. For instance, when looking at, like mentioned in the reading ""black lesbian women"" they see it as one whole and not separate measurable types. It ignores the true meaning of each separate description- black, lesbian, and women. This can effect on online users experience as it groups together certain things that shouldn't be. "

It is the cross section of 'gender', 'age', 'sexuality', 'class' etc. What procategorical intersectionality embodies is that we are more than just one measurable type. I am not just a ""woman"", but I am also a ""black"" + ""woman"". In social terms that has a different meaning, but in terms of data if a company, application, or business is trying to identity me, they would make more profit by combining these two parts of my 'identity' rather than just having one. It is creating an identity of myself that represents ""me"" in a more cumulative and datafied way. I am more than just one part of my ""identity"". ","I am a black woman, and in data terms I could be (depending on what I am labeled as) a ""black"" + ""woman"". So if an ad company wants to get my attention by showing me makeup for example, if Maybelline has a foundation line that is only usable for people with white and light skin tones, then I will not click on that ad. But because I am labeled as a ""black"" + ""woman"", they might show me makeup from black owned businesses, or makeup that is dark skinned friendly and has a foundation line that matches darker complexion. The implications of protocategorical insectionalities will allow me to be targeted better. Businesses, ads, and companies will have an easier time trying to get my attention because they can see multiple parts of my ""identity"", and use all of that data in order to best catch my attention. I then become an easier target ."
